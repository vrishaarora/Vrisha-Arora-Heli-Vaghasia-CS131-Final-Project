Final Project Idea: Empty seat detector (in libraries or cafes)

Use Case: 
In libraries, cafes, or other high-traffic locations with limited seating, time is often wasted by users wandering aimlessly looking for an empty seat. Especially during peak hours, staff have no real time insight into what space is available. In some cases open seats can appear occupied due to nearby user’s personal belongings leading to an inefficient use of space. The goal of this project is to create an edge-computing based empty seat detection system that can provide real-time updates of seat availability in public spaces while also protecting the privacy of customers. 
This project belongs to the smart infrastructure industry as it will use data analytics to monitor performance in real-time, optimize resource utilization, and reduce time wasted. This program can be applied to libraries, universities, cafes, airports, and other public waiting areas. It combines edge computing, system analysis, and computer vision to improve user experience, time consumption, and space utilization. 
There are a few challenges this project contains. Privacy issues, scalability, and misinformation are some of the major concerns at this time. Privacy poses a large concern as this project requires constant video monitoring. To ensure user privacy the raw data of this video should not be sent to the cloud or stored anywhere. Scalability is also a problem as we need this program to be able to work in larger spaces with different numbers of seats and rooms. Misinformation can be a factor as well since on camera large bags or jackets can appear as a person and be mislabeled as an occupied seat. The opposite is also true if a seat is labeled as available when a small child is occupying it. 

Solution: 
	The solution we propose is a multi-layer edge-fog-cloud system that will detect seat occupancy from data collected across multiple devices. Each seat should be monitored by an edge device, either a pressure sensor or a camera, which will detect if the seat is available. The device will perform local interference to determine whether the seat is occupied or not. This will ensure privacy for all customers of the establishment. Multiple edge devices will be required to communicate with a fog node that will combine the total seat availability across the room or building. The fog layer will conduct device coordination and data transmission. A cloud backend will be used for long term analytics and to improve the system based on false positives reported by the users. This will lead to more efficient device utilization in the future. 

Demo: 
The demo for this project will consist of a single edge computing device (our personal computer) built using a Jetson Nano developer kit connected to a camera. The system will process a live video stream in real time and identify whether seats within the camera’s field of view are occupied or empty. The demo will demonstrate on-device decision-making using computer vision.
During the demo, the Jetson Nano will capture video frames from the attached camera and run local code to classify seats as either occupied or empty. The inference process will occur entirely on the device, and the output will be visualized directly on the video stream by highlighting or labeling the empty seats. No video data will be transmitted, stored, or processed externally, ensuring that user privacy is preserved.
This demo will demonstrate how real-time sensing, processing, and decision-making can happen at the edge with minimal latency. While the demo will be a single device in a controlled environment, it shows the feasibility of using edge-based computer vision to detect seat availability in public spaces. The demo will represent a foundational implementation that can later be extended to multi-device models and higher-level analytics.

Task Distribution: 
	The system will include a Jetson Nano developer kit that will have an attached camera continuously capturing video data and processing it locally. The Jetson Nano will perform real-time processing on the video stream to determine whether seats within the camera’s field of view are occupied or empty. All computation will occur directly on the device, and the results will be displayed on the live video feed, ensuring low latency and preserving user privacy by keeping raw data at the edge.
Multiple edge devices will be supported by deploying more than one device such as the Jetson Nano, with each device monitoring a different seating area. These edge devices will interact by sharing their locally processed empty seat results rather than raw video data. This interaction will make sure there is coordinated reporting of seat availability across multiple locations while maintaining communication and minimizing the network overhead.
An intermediate fog computing device will be used to manage communication between edge devices and synchronize behavior that applies to the whole system. The fog node will put together seat occupancy information received from each Jetson Nano and will maintain an overall view of seat availability. It will also act as a communication gateway, managing data flow between the edge layer and external services while reducing the need for direct cloud communication from individual devices.
A cloud component will be included for higher-level computation that does not require real-time processing. Collected and anonymized seat availability data will be transmitted from the fog layer to the cloud, where it will be stored and analyzed to identify long-term usage patterns or system performance trends. This will allow the system to benefit from cloud analytics without impacting real-time edge performance.
